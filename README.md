**Latest Windows 11 build OptiGreat was tested on:** _22000.434_

# OptiGreat 11 
OptiGreat is a program created to make Windows faster, more privacy-respecting and much more secure for everyone. 

How does it do it? 

By tweaking various system settings, deleting useless apps and making sure your PC is up-to-date.
Gamers will appreciate lowered usage of RAM, CPU and disk usage, privacy-enthusiasts may enjoy the deleted telemetry, and any casual user will notice the boost in speed.

# Features
It has some features I haven't seen in other popular debloating tools:
 - Uninstalling Chromium Edge
 - Uninstalling Cortana
 - Disabling Defender
 - Disabling Optional Features
 - Disabling User Account Control
 - Disabling Ads

And many others:
- Disabling telemetry
- Changing your default drive if you have more drives to help you save space and lower the risk of losing data
- Replacing default apps with lighter and (mostly) open-source alternatives (Nana-Zip for managing archives, Photos > IrfanView64, Movies & TV -> VLC, BCUninstaller for uninstalling programs, NVCleanstall -> GeForce Experience...)
- Changing folder settings for security and speed (Showing file extensions, disabling ads in Explorer...)
 AND MORE!!!
 
 # Why OptiGreat?
 I've used many debloating scripts on my computers.
 I haven't found a single script that doesn't destroy Windows (e.g. non-working Store or broken Explorer) while also making a significant difference in performance.
 
 My main focus with OptiGreat was to make **the most effective Windows speed-up tool without sacrificing stability** - Windows remains 100% functional after the process as it is probably fully reversible!
 
So if you want to make your Windows 11 faster, more private,
more secure and less resource-heavy, feel free to use OptiGreat! :)

# Does OptiGreat work on Windows 10?
As Windows 11 is just an another layer of new features over Windows 10, OptiGreat should work there as well but I can't guarantee it (I tested it only on various Windows 11 builds).

Show support by donating to many programs used with OptiGreat like 7-Zip, Nana-Zip, VLC or LibreOffice! People behind them work really hard to make sure you have the best experience using their projects!

The whole program (OptiGreat 11) is written by myself but it downloads and uses a lot of third-party tools. (only with user's consent)
